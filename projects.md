The **ContinualAI** community is currently working on six completely open-source collaborative projects: Wiki, Colab, Avalanche, short-science, Paper DB] and CLAI Medium Publication.

<a name="wiki"></a>
<h3 id="wiki" style="margin-bottom:30px">Wiki</h3>
A central Hub of information for Continual Learning and AI.

<a name="colab"></a>
<h3 id="colab" style="margin-bottom:30px">Colab</h3>

A number of notebooks and scripts (for demo, showcasing & tutorials) which can be directly imported in Google Colab and are related to Continual Learning

<a name="avalanche"></a>
<h3 id="avalanche" style="margin-bottom:30px">Avalanche</h3>

A comprehensive framework for Continual Learning Research. It aims at unifying a set of popular CL baselines, environments and benchmarks to help algorithm prototyping and experiment, with flexibility, reproducibility, efficiency and maintainability in mind. Avalanche will be based on three main modules: datasets/environments, CL baselines and evaluation metrics/protocols.

<h3 id="avalanche" style="margin-bottom:30px">Short-Science Summary</h3>

Even considering only the topic of Continual Learning, keeping up with the huge amount of papers published today can be very difficult. This is why, in this project, we plan to contribute to the awesome short-science with short descriptions of CL papers.

<a name="paperdb"></a>
<h3 id="paperdb" style="margin-bottom:30px">Paper Database</h3>

Waiting for better AI tools for papers reccomendation the ContinualAI community is mantaining a database of CL papers which we plan to realease soon. It would be very rich of metadata so that we can better navigate the incredible number of papers published each year (query example: give me the papers employing reharsal and evaluated on CORe50). 

<a name="medium"></a>
<h3 id="medium" style="margin-bottom:30px">Medium Publication</h3>

At Continual AI we value scientific dissemination. We think that to advance science it is important to promote cutting-hedge research and make it accessible to a larger audience of people. This is why we maintain a Medium Publication where we try to distill and simplify the continual learning ideas with as little technical details as possible.
