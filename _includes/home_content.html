Humans have the extraordinary ability to <strong>learn continually</strong> from experience. Not only can we apply previously learned knowledge and skills to new situations, we can also use these as the foundation for later learning. One of the grand goals of AI is building an artificial <em>"Continual Learning"</em> agent that constructs a sophisticated understanding of the world from its own experience through the <strong> autonomous incremental development</strong> of ever more complex skills and knowledge.

**ContinualAI** is an official *non-profit research organization* and the *largest open community* on *Continual Learning for AI*. We aim at connecting people and working better together on this topic, which we consider fundamental for the future of AI. ContinualAI is a striving effort to make research in continual learning and AI more open, collaborative, democratic and transparent. We support *open science* at every level. Everything made at ContinualAI is open and freely accessible. But, maybe more importantly, all the projects are open-source and collaborative since the beginning (especially in the decision processes) and reflect the needs of the entire community itself. ContinualAI has three main objectives:  

- **[Connect](http://continualai.org//connect)**: Connecting researchers working on continual learning for AI is one of the reason ContinualAI exists today and one of the main goal of the organization.
- **[Research](http://continualai.org//research)**: at ContinualAI we work to create a distributed and inclusive research lab on Continual Learning, where anyone can contribute and learn more about this fascinating topic, while producing cutting edge research results.
- **[Educate](http://continualai.org//educate)**: Researchers should not only produce awesome research results but should be also concerned in making them accessible to anyone. This is way many projects are underway at ContinualAI to disseminate research in Continual Learning and related areas.
