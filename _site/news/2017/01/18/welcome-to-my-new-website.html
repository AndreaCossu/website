<p>Hi! :) And welcome to my new website! The new google sites seems great but lacks a lot of flexibility so I decided to switch to Github <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Pages</a> plus <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>. I found it incredibly powerful and flexible even though some people prefer <a href="http://docs.getpelican.com/en/stable/">Pelican</a> as static site generator.</p>

<p>Take a look around and take in mind the site is still under construction! :)</p>
