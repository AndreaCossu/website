<br>
**ContinualAI Research** is a research network, with the goal of supporting coordination and collaboration among continual learning labs across the world. 

The consortium of independent research labs called *ContinualAI Units*, in line with the *ContinualAI* mission, aims at accelerating the research progress in Continual Learning for AI.

Being part of *ContinualAI Research* network, allows every research lab, not matter its dimension, to collaborate and work better with the rest of the continual learning community, participating to research grants, sharing news and resources, connecting people and ultimately augmenting the impact of its research products.


This will, in turn, fortify the entire continual learning community, with a renewed, collaborative and inclusive spirit towards building better AI systems that can learn and think like humans. 


<a name="units"></a>
<h3 id="units" style="margin-bottom:30px">Units</h3>

A *ContinualAI* unit, is a research team (or a part of it) composed by **at least three people**, working continuously on *continual learning* or related topics. Below we report the list of the actual *ContinualAI Units* composing CLAIR:

- <a href="http://biolab.csr.unibo.it/home.asp" target="_blank">BioLab - University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy (PI: Davide Maltoni)</a>
- <a href="https://cms.brookes.ac.uk/staff/FabioCuzzolin" target="_blank">Visual Artificial Intelligence Laboratory - Oxford Brookes, Oxford, United Kingdom (PI: Fabio Cuzzolin)</a>
- <a href="https://www.continualai.org/lab" target="_blank">ContinualAI Lab - ContinualAI, Bologna, Italy (PI: Vincenzo Lomonaco)</a>
- <em>...To be announced shortly!</em>
