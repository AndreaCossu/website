<h3 id="background" style="margin-bottom: 30px;">Background on Continuous/Lifelong Learning</h3> 

**Continuous Learning** (CL) is built on the idea of learning continuously and adaptively about the external world and enabling the autonomous incremental development of ever more complex skills and knowledge. In the context of Machine Learning it means being able to smoothly update the prediction model to take into account different tasks and data distributions but still being able to re-use and retain useful knowledge and skills during time. 

Hence, CL is the only paradigm which force us to deal with an higher and realistic time-scale where data (and tasks) becomes available only during time, we have no access to previous perception data and itâ€™s imperative to build on top of previously learned knowledge.
