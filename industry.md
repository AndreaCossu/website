Nowadays, more and more companies begin to embrace the power of Machine Learning in different business processes. Generally, the typical pipeline applied by companies consists of gathering data, learning some underlying structure, and deploying an algorithm that systematically captures what you have learned.

Therefore, relying on continuous learning as opposed to algorithms that are trained offline is a beneficial opportunity for companies.
