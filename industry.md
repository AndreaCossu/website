Nowadays, more and more companies begin to embrace the power of Machine Learning in different business processes. Generally, the typical pipeline applied by companies consists of gathering data, learning some underlying structure, and deploying an algorithm that systematically captures what you have learned. Usually, gathering, preparing, and enriching the right training data is a key bottleneck among companies wanting to use machine learning. Therefore, relying on continuous learning as opposed to algorithms that are trained offline is a beneficial opportunity for companies.

In this section we provide a list of companies that exploit Continuous Learning approaches:

- [Neurala][neurala] uses deep learning neural network software that makes smart products (drones) more autonomous and useful. In particular, Neurala Lifelong Deep Neural Networks (Lifelong-DNN™) enable incremental learning of new objects on the fly, without the power of a server located in the cloud. Neurala accomplishes this by combining different neural network architectures (more info at [https://www.neurala.com/press-releases/edge-deep-learning-without-cloud][neurala-lifelong]).

-  [Amazon-Comprehend][Amazon-Comprehend] analyzes text and tells you what it finds, starting with the language, from Afrikans to Yoruba, with 98 more in between. It can identify different types of entities (people, places, brands, products, and so forth), key phrases, sentiment (positive, negative, mixed, or neutral), and extract key phrases, all from text in English or Spanish. Finally, Comprehend‘s topic modeling service extracts topics from large sets of documents for analysis or topic-based grouping

- [IBM-Watson][IBM-Watson] has embraced the phylosophy of Continuous Learning by providing automated monitoring of model performance, retraining, and redeployment to ensure prediction quality. IBM Watson allow data scientists and analysts to quickly build and prototype models, to monitor deployments, and to learn over time as more data become available.

<h3 id="projects" style="margin-bottom: 30px;">Future Applications</h3>

The future AI systems will rely on continuous learning as opposed to algorithms that are trained offline. There are many applications and scenarios where continuous learning already plays a central role or can be exploited for achieving better results. Here we provide a list of applications where Continuous Learning will make the difference:

- Robotics deals with use of robots where learning approaches are generally focused on discrete, e.g. single-task, learning events. However, in many applications robots need to be able to react to unexpected events and then update their models/policies to include the just encountered data points. Nowadays, Reinforcement Learning techniques are starting to provide robots and agents with such capabilities. 

- Object Recognition applications aims to recognize different categories of objects in an image. Incremental learning of new categories of objects, without forgetting previous ones, is extremely important for building lifelong autonomous systems.
